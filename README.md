# Plexed

Plexed is a Discord bot for my personal Plex server. 

Currently all it is capable of is using the psutils API to fetch the CPU and RAM usage of my Plex server in real time and report it to users in my Discord server. However, I have plans for the following:

- [x] Incorporate Tautalli API queries
- [x] Get status of Plex server (updating, online, offline...)
- [x] Get concurrent Plex streams
- [x] Get shows/movies currently being streamed
- [ ] Get total watch time from last:
  - [ ] 7 days
  - [ ] 30 Days
  - [ ] 90 Days
  - [ ] 1 year
  - [ ] All time (not sure if possible with Tautulli api)
